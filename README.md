# React-Native_portfolio-

Started working on a React Native app that will be a mini-porfolio page. Currently holds some project links (Some unfinished). My goal is to publish this on the
android store (eventually on ios store as well but Apple wants to charge me a lot for a developer liscense) and then have a link to the app on my resume so 
potential employers can download my app and check out my resume/projects on there. 

Currently still a work in progress but mostly done. Feel free to run it on your emulator and check it out
